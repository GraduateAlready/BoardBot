# BoardBot

BoardGAN is a deep convolutional generative adversarial network that generates routes on climbing training boards. It has a live web version where model inference can be run via Flask, React, and Tensorflow.js. Generated routes are automatically pushed to their corresponding IOS/Android apps for climbers to use for training. It currently supports and is trained on the 12x12 kilterboard. Upcoming features include a conditional model that supports difficulty and climbing angle adjustment, word embedding into latent space for descriptive natural language processed routes, and support for different board configurations and brands.

### --- Before Starting --- 
   
Install Node.js on the host system.
Check successful installation by running:

$ node -v

$ npm -v

These should successfully return the node and npm versions of the system.

Install Python 3 on the host system.
Check successful installation by running:

$ python --version 

or 

$ python3 --version (for Linux Users)


### --- Project Dependencies ---

The project requires dependencies from both Node and Python. This involves the node_modules and the python libraries.
To install node_modules, run:

$npm install

To install python libraries, run:

$python install -r requirements.txt

### --- Structure of the Program --- 

The program is run by first running the Python Flask using:

$ python app.py

or 

$ python app.py (for Linux Users)

Then on another terminal, node can be run using:

$ npm start
